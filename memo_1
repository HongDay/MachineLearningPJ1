<drawbacks for baseline model(face=face bad)>

The current model performs worse compared to ResNet-50 because:
It is shallow and lacks the depth needed to extract complex features.
It is trained from scratch, while ResNet-50 benefits from pre-trained weights.
It struggles with class imbalance and overfits the majority class.
It lacks the architectural advantages of residual connections, which allow ResNet-50 to learn deeper representations effectively.
